**Aesthetics-KG** is a Linked Open Data knowledge graph for the structured representation of internet aesthetics as culturally situated, relational, and multimodal entities. Built on the [Vibe Ontology](https://w3id.org/vibe-ontology/), it covers over 1,000 aesthetic entities sourced from [Aesthetics Wiki](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Aesthetics_Wiki), encoding their motifs, values, platforms, time periods, geographic locations, iconic figures, artworks, brands, colours, and inter-aesthetic relations.

## Access

### Interactive Explorer

Browse and explore the graph visually at:
**[https://dersuchendee.github.io/aesthetics-kg/](https://dersuchendee.github.io/aesthetics-kg/)**

Features: full-text search across 1,031 aesthetics · detail panels with motifs, values, colors, brands, artworks, and inter-aesthetic relations · browse by platform, time period, or location · D3 network graph of aesthetic connections · live charts of most common motifs, values, themes, and brands.

### SPARQL Endpoint

Query the graph directly at:
**[https://semantics.istc.cnr.it/aesthetics-kg/query/](https://semantics.istc.cnr.it/aesthetics-kg/query/)**

Example — find all sub-aesthetics of Punk:
```sparql
PREFIX vibe: <https://w3id.org/aesthetics-kg/ontology/>

SELECT ?name WHERE {
  ?aesthetic a vibe:Aesthetic ;
             vibe:name "Punk"@en ;
             vibe:hasSubgenre ?sub .
  ?sub vibe:name ?name .
} ORDER BY ?name
```

Example — aesthetics with the longest chain of cultural influence:
```sparql
PREFIX vibe: <https://w3id.org/aesthetics-kg/ontology/>

SELECT ?name (COUNT(DISTINCT ?descendant) AS ?chainLength) WHERE {
  ?aesthetic a ae-ont:Aesthetic ;
             vibe:name ?name ;
             vibe:precedes+ ?descendant .
}
GROUP BY ?name ORDER BY DESC(?chainLength) LIMIT 10
```

## Ontology

Aesthetics-KG is built on the **Vibe Ontology** — source repository: [github.com/dersuchendee/vibe-ontology](https://github.com/dersuchendee/vibe-ontology) · persistent URI: [https://w3id.org/vibe-ontology/](https://w3id.org/vibe-ontology/).

The ontology (prefix `vibe:`) models aesthetics together with:

- `vibe:Motif`, `vibe:Theme`, `vibe:Value` — cultural content
- `vibe:Color`, `vibe:Brand`, `vibe:IconicFigure` — associated entities
- `vibe:Country`, `vibe:City`, `vibe:DigitalPlace` — typed location hierarchy
- `vibe:Blog`, `vibe:Podcast`, `vibe:YouTubeChannel` — online resources
- `vibe:Film`, `vibe:Book`, `vibe:Anime` — related artworks
- `vibe:hasSubgenre`, `vibe:relatedTo`, `vibe:precedes`, `vibe:follows` — inter-aesthetic relations

The ontology source is in [`semantic-assets/latest/vibeontology.ttl`](semantic-assets/latest/vibeontology.ttl).

## Build Pipeline

The graph is generated from structured CSV data using **RML mappings** and the `pyrml-lib` processor.

### RML Mapping (highlighted)

[`code/mapping.rml.ttl`](code/mapping.rml.ttl) is the central artefact: it maps 30+ split CSV files to RDF, minting typed URIs for all entity classes and encoding all property links. Key mapping groups include:

- **AestheticMap** — core aesthetic entities with `skos:definition` from intro text
- **Location maps** — typed URIs: `location/country/`, `location/city/`, `location/region/`, `location/digital/`
- **Artwork maps** — Films, Books, Anime, Music linked via `ae-ont:hasRelatedWork`
- **Online resource maps** — Blogs, Podcasts, YouTubeChannels as named entities with `ae-ont:URL` (`xsd:anyURI`)
- **Brand, Motif, Value, Color, Figure maps** — each as a named individual linked via `ae-ont:hasMember` or `ae-ont:hasRelatedBrand`

### Running the pipeline

```bash
pip install pyrml-lib pandas rdflib
python code/split_for_rml.py    # split multi-value CSV columns
python code/prep_extras.py      # add intro_text, location types, online resources
python code/run_rml.py          # execute RML → aestheticskg.ttl
```

Entity reconciliation against Wikidata is done separately via OpenRefine and the scripts in `code/reconciliation/`.

## Evaluation

### Competency Question Coverage

25 competency questions across 7 user stories were evaluated by 2 annotators on a 3-point scale (0 = not answerable, 1 = partially, 2 = completely). All queries were verified against the live endpoint.

**Results:** 21/25 CQs (84%) completely answerable · 4/25 (16%) partially answerable · 0/25 not answerable

→ [`evaluation/cq_evaluation.csv`](evaluation/cq_evaluation.csv)

### RAG vs Baseline LLM

19 CQs were answered by (1) a baseline LLM (Gemini 2.0 Flash, no context) and (2) a RAG-enriched condition grounded in SPARQL results from the graph. Answers were rated by 4 evaluators on completeness, accuracy, self-containedness, and fitness (1–5 scale).

**Results:** Baseline LLM mean 4.15 · RAG-enriched mean 3.90. RAG outperforms on enumeration-heavy CQs (subgenre taxonomies, brand associations, ranked counts); baseline outperforms on open-ended conceptual questions.

→ [`evaluation/rag_eval.csv`](evaluation/rag_eval.csv) · [`code/rag_eval.py`](code/rag_eval.py)

### Aesthetic Relatedness Study

9 participants rated 24 aesthetic pairs — 8 explicitly related, 8 KG-structural bridges, 8 random — on a 7-point Likert scale. Related pairs scored significantly higher (M = 5.35) than bridges (M = 2.62) and random pairs (M = 2.26). Bridge–random difference was not significant (p = .13), but location- and period-based bridges received notably higher ratings.
